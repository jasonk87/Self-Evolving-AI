# --- Detailed Design Comments for Future Implementation ---
#
# 1.  User Confirmation:
#     - This tool should ONLY be called AFTER explicit user confirmation has been 
#       received through the primary agent interface (e.g., chat). The agent must
#       present the planned push operation (what branch to what remote) and get
#       a "yes" or equivalent from the user.
#
# 2.  Prerequisites:
#     - Git Command-Line Tool: Verify `git` is available using `shutil.which("git")`.
#       If not found, return an error: "Git command not found. Please ensure Git is installed and in PATH."
#     - Valid Git Repository: Check if `project_root` is a Git repository by verifying
#       `os.path.isdir(os.path.join(project_root, ".git"))`.
#       If not, return an error: f"Project root '{project_root}' is not a valid Git repository."
#     - Remote Existence (Optional but Recommended): Check if `remote_name` exists using 
#       `git remote get-url <remote_name>`. If it fails, it might indicate the remote
#       is not configured. This check can be tricky as `get-url` might fail for other
#       reasons too. A simpler check is `git remote show <remote_name>`, though its output
#       parsing is more involved. For an initial version, one might skip this and let `git push` fail.
#
# 3.  Branch Handling:
#     - Determine Target Branch:
#       target_branch_to_push = branch_name
#       if target_branch_to_push is None:
#           try:
#               result = subprocess.run(
#                   [git_path, "rev-parse", "--abbrev-ref", "HEAD"],
#                   cwd=project_root, capture_output=True, text=True, check=True, timeout=5
#               )
#               target_branch_to_push = result.stdout.strip()
#               if not target_branch_to_push or target_branch_to_push == "HEAD":
#                   # HEAD means detached state, which is problematic for pushing.
#                   return "Error: Could not determine current branch or in detached HEAD state. Please specify a branch."
#           except Exception as e:
#               logger.error(f"Error determining current branch: {e}")
#               return f"Error determining current branch: {e}"
#     - Active Branch Check (Consideration):
#       Strict version: Only allow pushing the currently active branch.
#       Flexible version: If `branch_name` is provided and is not the current branch,
#                         either (a) fail with a message, or (b) (more complex, riskier)
#                         attempt `git checkout <branch_name>` first. Option (a) is safer.
#                         For now, assume we push `target_branch_to_push` regardless of current
#                         active branch, but `git push` might require it to be the current one
#                         or use a refspec like `HEAD:<target_branch_to_push>`.
#                         The command `git push <remote_name> <target_branch_to_push>` usually works
#                         for local branches that exist.
#
# 4.  Safety Checks (Before Push):
#     - Uncommitted Changes:
#       `status_result = subprocess.run([git_path, "status", "--porcelain"], ...)`
#       If `status_result.stdout` is not empty, there are uncommitted changes or untracked files.
#       Return an error: "Working directory is not clean. Please commit or stash changes before pushing."
#     - Local Branch Behind Remote:
#       `log_result = subprocess.run([git_path, "log", f"@{u}.."], ...)` 
#       (or `git rev-list --count @{u}..HEAD`)
#       If this shows any commits, the local branch has commits not on the remote tracking branch,
#       which is fine. The opposite (`git log ..@{u}`) checks if remote is ahead.
#       A more direct check for "behind" status:
#       `git fetch <remote_name>` (to update remote refs)
#       `status_short_result = subprocess.run([git_path, "status", "-sb"], ...)`
#       Parse output for `[behind X]` pattern. If found, warn:
#       "Local branch is behind remote. Please pull first to avoid potential conflicts."
#       Alternatively, allow push with `--force-with-lease` but this is very risky for AI.
#       Simplest initial approach: Warn if behind, or proceed with push and let Git handle conflicts.
#       A safer initial approach is to fail if behind:
#       `git fetch <remote_name> <target_branch_to_push>` (fetches specific branch)
#       `rev_list_behind = subprocess.run([git_path, "rev-list", "--count", f"HEAD..{remote_name}/{target_branch_to_push}"], ...)`
#       `rev_list_ahead = subprocess.run([git_path, "rev-list", "--count", f"{remote_name}/{target_branch_to_push}..HEAD"], ...)`
#       If `rev_list_behind` > 0, then remote is ahead (local is behind). Fail or warn.
#
# 5.  Git Push Command (using `subprocess.run`):
#     - Command: `[git_path, "push", remote_name, target_branch_to_push]`
#     - `push_result = subprocess.run(command, cwd=project_root, capture_output=True, text=True, timeout=60)`
#     - Check `push_result.returncode`.
#     - Log `push_result.stdout` and `push_result.stderr`.
#     - Potential errors to handle:
#       - Authentication failures (Git will prompt if not configured; subprocess will hang or fail depending on config).
#         This implies credentials must be pre-configured (SSH keys, credential helper).
#       - Network issues.
#       - Rejections (e.g., non-fast-forward if local branch was behind and not rebased/merged).
#         This is where the safety check for being behind is important.
#
# 6.  Output/Return:
#     - Success: `f"Successfully pushed branch '{target_branch_to_push}' to remote '{remote_name}' in project '{project_root}'. Git output:\n{push_result.stdout}\n{push_result.stderr}"`
#     - Failure: `f"Failed to push branch ... Error: {push_result.stderr or 'Unknown error'}"`
#
# 7.  Security:
#     - Git operations involving remotes can require credentials. The environment where the
#       agent runs needs to be configured appropriately (e.g., SSH keys added to the
#       ssh-agent, Git credential helper configured, or HTTPS token used).
#     - The agent should not handle raw credentials directly.
